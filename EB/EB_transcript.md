1. This is a project titled *Increase in venous [K+] During Hyperbaric Exposure Independent of Changes in pH or O2 Concentration*.

2. First some background on this topic,
3. Changes in pressure and oxygen concentration can be used to modulate oxygen levels in humans.
4. This fact is critical to a few prominent treatments;
   1. The first being hyperoxia which is described as an increase in concentration of inspired oxygen gas
   2. The second is hyperbaric treatment which is an increase in pressure
   3. And the third, hyperbaric oxygen, is a combination of the two previously mentioned treatments and is the increase in both ambient pressure and concentration of oxygen gas administered
5. All three of these treatments have varying amounts of research on their effects on plasma potassium
6. In hyperoxias case it has been shown to cause an increase potassium levels in some studies and lead to know significant changes in others
7. On the other hand the effects of hyperbaria on plasma potassium are understudied with little to no research on the topic
8. However Hif-1$\alpha$ has been implicated in changes in potassium as a response to hypoxia. This is important because Hif-1$\alpha$ is also important for physiological responses to Hyperbaria and hyperoxia

9. And so the aim of this study was to determine the effect of hyperbaric treatment and concentrated oxygen on venous metabolites

10. This was accomplished by the following methods
11. Subjects were randomly selected from a population of health adults.
12. The were then separated into 2 groups which were
  1. A hyperbaric treatment group with an n of 10
  2. and a concentrated oxygen group with an n of 12
13. These subjects received a total of 10 treatments
14. On the day of the first treatment subjects arrived ahead of treatment and factors such as height and weight were recored
15. Blood draws were also preformed and basic metabolic panels were obtained with an arterial blood gas machine
16. In total 36 biomarkers were obtained
17. Following this draw subjects underwent thier respective treatment
  1. For the hyperbaric this was 1.5 hrs at 1.3 atm
  2. For the concentrated oxygen group this was 1 hr at 100% oxygen
18. Immediately after this treatment another blood draw was preformed and a metabolic panel was obtained
19. Subjects then underwent 9 more treatments, taking a treatment break for the weekend.
20. Prior to the final treatment a blood draw was preformed and again analyzed
21. The final blood draw occurred on the following Monday 3 days post final treatment
22. results were compared pairwise using a paired Wilcoxon test
