	abstract = {It has been widely held that the changes in plasma potassium concentration observed during acute acid-base disorders are solely determined by the associated changes in blood acidity. However, a critical examination of the literature uncovers wide differences among the four cardinal acid-base disorders with respect to the associated changes in plasma potassium concentration. In fact, the data suggest that a host of factors other than the attendant changes in plasma hydrogen ion concentration may well modulate the intercompartmental distribution of body potassium during acid-base disorders. In this study we review the qualitative, quantitative and mechanistic aspects of the plasma potassium response to acute alterations in blood acidity.},

Potassium homeostasis during intermittent ingestion of K+ involves rapid redistribution of K+ into the intracellular space to minimize increases in extracellular K+ concentration, and ultimate elimination of the K+ load by renal excretion. Recent years have seen great progress in identifying the transporters and channels involved in renal and extrarenal K+ homeostasis. Here we apply these advances in molecular physiology to understand how acid-base disturbances affect serum potassium.},

The purpose of this study was to determine whether this phenomenon occurs in humans. The effect of hypoxia on [K+]a was measured in ten male subjects, at rest and during light exercise, before and after 8 weeks of physical training. The [K+]a increased by 0.15 +/- 0.04 mM (mean +/- S.E.M.) at rest, when end-tidal PO2 (PET,O2) was lowered from 100 to 51 +/- 1.6 Torr, and by 0.10 +/- 0.02 mM during exercise, when PET,O2 was lowered from 100 to 66 +/- 6.2 Torr. Physical training did not alter the rise in [K+]a significantly. The magnitude of this effect is small in comparison with that of exercise-induced hyperkalaemia, and is unlikely to be of great physiological significance at moderate levels of hypoxia.},

Whether HIF-1 regulates hypoxia-induced Kv channel expression in cultured pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs), however, has not been determined. In this study, we investigated the effects of hypoxia on the expression of Kv1.2 Kv1.5, Kv2.1, and Kv9.3 channels in PASMCs and examined the direct role of HIF-1 by transfecting either wild type or mutant EPO enhancer fragments. Our results showed that 18 h exposure to hypoxia significantly increased the expression of Kv1.2, Kv1.5, Kv2.1, and Kv9.3; and this hypoxia-induced upregulation was completely inhibited after transfection with the wild type but not mutant EPO enhancer fragment. These results indicate that HIF-1 regulates hypoxia-stimulated induction of Kv1.2 Kv1.5, Kv2.1, and Kv9.3 channels in cultured PASMCs.},

	abstract = {Prolonged exposure to decreased oxygen tension causes contraction and proliferation of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) and pulmonary hypertension. Hypoxia-induced inhibition of voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels may contribute to the development of pulmonary hypertension by increasing intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). The peptide endothelin-1 (ET-1) has been implicated in the development of pulmonary hypertension and acutely decreases Kv channel activity. ET-1 also activates several transcription factors, although whether ET-1 alters KV channel expression is unclear. The hypoxic induction of ET-1 is regulated by the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), which we demonstrated to regulate hypoxia-induced decreases in KV channel activity. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that HIF-1-dependent increases in ET-1 lead to decreased Kv channel expression and subsequent elevation in [Ca2+]i. Resting [Ca2+]i and Kv channel expression were measured in cells exposed to control (18\% O2, 5\% CO2) and hypoxic (4\% O2, 5\% CO2) conditions. Hypoxia caused a decrease in expression of Kv1.5 and Kv2.1 and a significant increase in resting [Ca2+]i. The increase in [Ca2+]i was reduced by nifedipine, an inhibitor of voltage-dependent calcium channels, and removal of extracellular calcium. Treatment with BQ-123, an ET-1 receptor inhibitor, prevented the hypoxia-induced decrease in Kv channel expression and blunted the hypoxia-induced increase in [Ca2+]i in PASMCs, whereas ET-1 mimicked the effects of hypoxia. Both hypoxia and overexpression of HIF-1 under normoxic conditions increased ET-1 expression. These results suggest that the inhibition of Kv channel expression and rise in [Ca2+]i during chronic hypoxia may be the result of HIF-1-dependent induction of ET-1.},

	abstract = {The potassium homeostatic system is very tightly regulated. Recent studies have shed light on the sensing and molecular mechanisms responsible for this tight control. In addition to classic feedback regulation mediated by a rise in extracellular Ô¨Çuid (ECF) [K+], there is evidence for a feedforward mechanism: Dietary K+ intake is sensed in the gut, and an unidentiÔ¨Åed gut factor is activated to stimulate renal K+ excretion. This pathway may explain renal and extrarenal responses to altered K+ intake that occur independently of changes in ECF [K+]. Mechanisms for conserving ECF K+ during fasting or K+ deprivation have been described: Kidney NADPH oxidase activation initiates a cascade that provokes the retraction of K+ channels from the cell membrane, and muscle becomes resistant to insulin stimulation of cellular K+ uptake. How these mechanisms are triggered by K+ deprivation remains unclear. Cellular AMP kinase‚Äìdependent protein kinase activity provokes the acute transfer of K+ from the ECF to the ICF, which may be important in exercise or ischemia. These recent advances may shed light on the beneÔ¨Åcial effects of a high-K+ diet for the cardiovascular system.},

Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a transcription factor that regulates oxygen homeostasis and plays key roles in development, physiology, and disease. HIF-1 activity is induced in response to continuous hypoxia, intermittent hypoxia, growth factor stimulation, and Ca2+ signaling. HIF-1 mediates adaptive responses to hypoxia, including erythropoiesis, angiogenesis, and metabolic reprogramming. In each case, HIF-1 regulates the expression of multiple genes encoding key components of the response pathway. HIF-1 also mediates maladaptive responses to chronic continuous and intermittent hypoxia, which underlie the development of pulmonary and systemic hypertension, respectively.},
