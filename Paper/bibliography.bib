   abstract = {Maintenance of extracellular K(+) concentration within a narrow range is vital for numerous cell functions, particularly electrical excitability of heart and muscle. Potassium homeostasis during intermittent ingestion of K(+) involves rapid redistribution of K(+) into the intracellular space to minimize increases in extracellular K(+) concentration, and ultimate elimination of the K(+) load by renal excretion. Recent years have seen great progress in identifying the transporters and channels involved in renal and extrarenal K(+) homeostasis. Here we apply these advances in molecular physiology to understand how acid-base disturbances affect serum potassium.},
