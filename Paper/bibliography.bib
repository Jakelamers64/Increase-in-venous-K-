However, a critical examination of the literature uncovers wide differences among the four cardinal acid-base disorders with respect to the associated changes in plasma potassium concentration. In fact, the data suggest that a host of factors other than the attendant changes in plasma hydrogen ion concentration may well modulate the intercompartmental distribution of body potassium during acid-base disorders. In this study we review the qualitative, quantitative and mechanistic aspects of the plasma potassium response to acute alterations in blood acidity.},

The [K+]a increased by 0.15 +/- 0.04 mM (mean +/- S.E.M.) at rest, when end-tidal PO2 (PET,O2) was lowered from 100 to 51 +/- 1.6 Torr, and by 0.10 +/- 0.02 mM during exercise, when PET,O2 was lowered from 100 to 66 +/- 6.2 Torr. Physical training did not alter the rise in [K+]a significantly.

Hypoxia-induced inhibition of voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels may contribute to the development of pulmonary hypertension by increasing intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). The peptide endothelin-1 (ET-1) has been implicated in the development of pulmonary hypertension and acutely decreases Kv channel activity. ET-1 also activates several transcription factors, although whether ET-1 alters KV channel expression is unclear. The hypoxic induction of ET-1 is regulated by the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), which we demonstrated to regulate hypoxia-induced decreases in KV channel activity. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that HIF-1-dependent increases in ET-1 lead to decreased Kv channel expression and subsequent elevation in [Ca2+]i. Resting [Ca2+]i and Kv channel expression were measured in cells exposed to control (18\% O2, 5\% CO2) and hypoxic (4\% O2, 5\% CO2) conditions. Hypoxia caused a decrease in expression of Kv1.5 and Kv2.1 and a significant increase in resting [Ca2+]i. The increase in [Ca2+]i was reduced by nifedipine, an inhibitor of voltage-dependent calcium channels, and removal of extracellular calcium. Treatment with BQ-123, an ET-1 receptor inhibitor, prevented the hypoxia-induced decrease in Kv channel expression and blunted the hypoxia-induced increase in [Ca2+]i in PASMCs, whereas ET-1 mimicked the effects of hypoxia. Both hypoxia and overexpression of HIF-1 under normoxic conditions increased ET-1 expression. These results suggest that the inhibition of Kv channel expression and rise in [Ca2+]i during chronic hypoxia may be the result of HIF-1-dependent induction of ET-1.},

In addition to classic feedback regulation mediated by a rise in extracellular Ô¨Çuid (ECF) [K+], there is evidence for a feedforward mechanism: Dietary K+ intake is sensed in the gut, and an unidentiÔ¨Åed gut factor is activated to stimulate renal K+ excretion. This pathway may explain renal and extrarenal responses to altered K+ intake that occur independently of changes in ECF [K+]. Mechanisms for conserving ECF K+ during fasting or K+ deprivation have been described: Kidney NADPH oxidase activation initiates a cascade that provokes the retraction of K+ channels from the cell membrane, and muscle becomes resistant to insulin stimulation of cellular K+ uptake. How these mechanisms are triggered by K+ deprivation remains unclear. Cellular AMP kinase‚Äìdependent protein kinase activity provokes the acute transfer of K+ from the ECF to the ICF, which may be important in exercise or ischemia. These recent advances may shed light on the beneÔ¨Åcial effects of a high-K+ diet for the cardiovascular system.},

Therefore, we hypothesized that TREK-1 activation protects against HALI. We treated HO-exposed mice and primary alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) with the novel TREK-1 activators ML335 and BL1249, and quantified physiological, histological, and biochemical lung injury markers. We determined the effects of these drugs on epithelial TREK-1 currents, plasma membrane potential (Em), and intracellular Ca

              ) as a downstream mechanism of cytokine secretion. Once-daily, intra-tracheal injections of HO-exposed mice with ML335 or BL1249 improved lung compliance, histological lung injury scores, broncho-alveolar lavage protein levels and cell counts, and IL-6 and IP-10 concentrations. TREK-1 activation also decreased IL-6, IP-10, and CCL-2 secretion from primary AECs. Mechanistically, ML335 and BL1249 induced TREK-1 currents in AECs, counteracted HO-induced cell depolarization, and lowered iCa

              concentrations. In addition, CCL-2 secretion was decreased after L-type Ca

In the present study, we investigated the electrical changes and redox abnormalities caused by 72 h hyperoxia treatment in mice. Cardiac repolarization changes were assessed by acquiring electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiac action potentials (AP). Biochemical assays were employed to identify the pyridine nucleotide changes, Kv1.5 expression and myocardial injury. Hyperoxia treatment caused marked bradycardia, arrhythmia and signiÔ¨Åcantly prolonged (ms) the, RR (186.2 ¬± 10.7 vs. 146.4 ¬± 6.2), PR (46.8 ¬± 3.1 vs. 39.3 ¬± 1.6), QRS (10.8 ¬± 0.6 vs. 8.5 ¬± 0.2), QTc (57.1 ¬± 3.5 vs. 40 ¬± 1.4) and JT (13.4 ¬± 2.1 vs. 7.0 ¬± 0.5) intervals, when compared with normoxia group.

Hyperoxia exposure altered cardiac levels of mRNA/ protein expression of; Kv1.5, KvŒ≤ subunits and SiRT1, and increased ratios of reduced pyridine nucleotides (NADH/NAD \& NADPH/NADP). Inhibition of SiRT1 in H9C2 cells using Splitomicin resulted in decreased SiRT1 and Kv1.5 expression, suggesting that SiRT1 may mediate Kv1.5 downregulation.

              channel (K2P) Trek-1 has recently been described in lung epithelial cells, but its function remains elusive. In this study we hypothesized that hyperoxia affects expression of Trek-1 in alveolar epithelial cells and that Trek-1 is involved in regulation of cell proliferation and cytokine secretion. We found gene expression of several K2P channels in mouse alveolar epithelial cells (MLE-12), and expression of Trek-1 was significantly downregulated in cultured cells and lungs of mice exposed to hyperoxia. Similarly, proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Cyclin D1 expression were downregulated by exposure to hyperoxia. We developed an MLE-12 cell line deficient in Trek-1 expression using shRNA and found that Trek-1 deficiency resulted in increased cell proliferation and upregulation of PCNA but not Cyclin D1. Furthermore, IL-6 and regulated on activation normal T-expressed and presumably secreted (RANTES) secretion was decreased in Trek-1-deficient cells, whereas release of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 was increased. Release of KC/IL-8 was not affected by Trek-1 deficiency. Overall, deficiency of Trek-1 had a more pronounced effect on mediator secretion than exposure to hyperoxia. This is the first report suggesting that the K
