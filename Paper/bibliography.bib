	abstract = {Hyperoxia can lead to a myriad of deleterious effects in the lung including epithelial damage and diffuse inflammation. The specific mechanisms by which hyperoxia promotes these pathological changes are not completely understood. Activation of ion channels has been proposed as one of the mechanisms required for cell activation and mediator secretion. The two-pore-domain K
              +
              channel (K2P) Trek-1 has recently been described in lung epithelial cells, but its function remains elusive. In this study we hypothesized that hyperoxia affects expression of Trek-1 in alveolar epithelial cells and that Trek-1 is involved in regulation of cell proliferation and cytokine secretion. We found gene expression of several K2P channels in mouse alveolar epithelial cells (MLE-12), and expression of Trek-1 was significantly downregulated in cultured cells and lungs of mice exposed to hyperoxia. Similarly, proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Cyclin D1 expression were downregulated by exposure to hyperoxia. We developed an MLE-12 cell line deficient in Trek-1 expression using shRNA and found that Trek-1 deficiency resulted in increased cell proliferation and upregulation of PCNA but not Cyclin D1. Furthermore, IL-6 and regulated on activation normal T-expressed and presumably secreted (RANTES) secretion was decreased in Trek-1-deficient cells, whereas release of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 was increased. Release of KC/IL-8 was not affected by Trek-1 deficiency. Overall, deficiency of Trek-1 had a more pronounced effect on mediator secretion than exposure to hyperoxia. This is the first report suggesting that the K
              +
              channel Trek-1 could be involved in regulation of alveolar epithelial cell proliferation and cytokine secretion, but a direct association with hyperoxia-induced changes in Trek-1 levels remains elusive.},

Because redox balance of pyridine nucleotides affects Kv function and hyperoxia alters cellular redox potential, we hypothesized that hyperoxia exposure leads to cardiac ion channel disturbances and redox changes resulting in arrhythmias. In the present study, we investigated the electrical changes and redox abnormalities caused by 72 h hyperoxia treatment in mice. Cardiac repolarization changes were assessed by acquiring electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiac action potentials (AP). Biochemical assays were employed to identify the pyridine nucleotide changes, Kv1.5 expression and myocardial injury. Hyperoxia treatment caused marked bradycardia, arrhythmia and signiﬁcantly prolonged (ms) the, RR (186.2 ± 10.7 vs. 146.4 ± 6.2), PR (46.8 ± 3.1 vs. 39.3 ± 1.6), QRS (10.8 ± 0.6 vs. 8.5 ± 0.2), QTc (57.1 ± 3.5 vs. 40 ± 1.4) and JT (13.4 ± 2.1 vs. 7.0 ± 0.5) intervals, when compared with normoxia group. Hyperoxia treatment also induced signiﬁcant increase in cardiac action potential duration (APD) (ex-APD90; 73.8 ± 9.5 vs. 50.9 ± 3.1 ms) and elevated levels of serum markers of myocardial injury; cardiac troponin I (TnI) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Hyperoxia exposure altered cardiac levels of mRNA/ protein expression of; Kv1.5, Kvβ subunits and SiRT1, and increased ratios of reduced pyridine nucleotides (NADH/NAD \& NADPH/NADP). Inhibition of SiRT1 in H9C2 cells using Splitomicin resulted in decreased SiRT1 and Kv1.5 expression, suggesting that SiRT1 may mediate Kv1.5 downregulation.

Therefore, we hypothesized that TREK-1 activation protects against HALI. We treated HO-exposed mice and primary alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) with the novel TREK-1 activators ML335 and BL1249, and quantified physiological, histological, and biochemical lung injury markers. We determined the effects of these drugs on epithelial TREK-1 currents, plasma membrane potential (Em), and intracellular Ca

              ) as a downstream mechanism of cytokine secretion. Once-daily, intra-tracheal injections of HO-exposed mice with ML335 or BL1249 improved lung compliance, histological lung injury scores, broncho-alveolar lavage protein levels and cell counts, and IL-6 and IP-10 concentrations. TREK-1 activation also decreased IL-6, IP-10, and CCL-2 secretion from primary AECs. Mechanistically, ML335 and BL1249 induced TREK-1 currents in AECs, counteracted HO-induced cell depolarization, and lowered iCa

              concentrations. In addition, CCL-2 secretion was decreased after L-type Ca

	abstract = {The potassium homeostatic system is very tightly regulated. Recent studies have shed light on the sensing and molecular mechanisms responsible for this tight control. In addition to classic feedback regulation mediated by a rise in extracellular ﬂuid (ECF) [K+], there is evidence for a feedforward mechanism: Dietary K+ intake is sensed in the gut, and an unidentiﬁed gut factor is activated to stimulate renal K+ excretion. This pathway may explain renal and extrarenal responses to altered K+ intake that occur independently of changes in ECF [K+]. Mechanisms for conserving ECF K+ during fasting or K+ deprivation have been described: Kidney NADPH oxidase activation initiates a cascade that provokes the retraction of K+ channels from the cell membrane, and muscle becomes resistant to insulin stimulation of cellular K+ uptake. How these mechanisms are triggered by K+ deprivation remains unclear. Cellular AMP kinase–dependent protein kinase activity provokes the acute transfer of K+ from the ECF to the ICF, which may be important in exercise or ischemia. These recent advances may shed light on the beneﬁcial effects of a high-K+ diet for the cardiovascular system.},

	abstract = {Prolonged exposure to decreased oxygen tension causes contraction and proliferation of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) and pulmonary hypertension. Hypoxia-induced inhibition of voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels may contribute to the development of pulmonary hypertension by increasing intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). The peptide endothelin-1 (ET-1) has been implicated in the development of pulmonary hypertension and acutely decreases Kv channel activity. ET-1 also activates several transcription factors, although whether ET-1 alters KV channel expression is unclear. The hypoxic induction of ET-1 is regulated by the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), which we demonstrated to regulate hypoxia-induced decreases in KV channel activity. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that HIF-1-dependent increases in ET-1 lead to decreased Kv channel expression and subsequent elevation in [Ca2+]i. Resting [Ca2+]i and Kv channel expression were measured in cells exposed to control (18\% O2, 5\% CO2) and hypoxic (4\% O2, 5\% CO2) conditions. Hypoxia caused a decrease in expression of Kv1.5 and Kv2.1 and a significant increase in resting [Ca2+]i. The increase in [Ca2+]i was reduced by nifedipine, an inhibitor of voltage-dependent calcium channels, and removal of extracellular calcium. Treatment with BQ-123, an ET-1 receptor inhibitor, prevented the hypoxia-induced decrease in Kv channel expression and blunted the hypoxia-induced increase in [Ca2+]i in PASMCs, whereas ET-1 mimicked the effects of hypoxia. Both hypoxia and overexpression of HIF-1 under normoxic conditions increased ET-1 expression. These results suggest that the inhibition of Kv channel expression and rise in [Ca2+]i during chronic hypoxia may be the result of HIF-1-dependent induction of ET-1.},

Our results showed that 18 h exposure to hypoxia significantly increased the expression of Kv1.2, Kv1.5, Kv2.1, and Kv9.3; and this hypoxia-induced upregulation was completely inhibited after transfection with the wild type but not mutant EPO enhancer fragment.

All patients had in-hospital serum potassium measurements and were categorized by mean postadmission serum potassium level (\&lt;3.0, 3.0-\&lt;3.5, 3.5-\&lt;4.0, 4.0-\&lt;4.5, 4.5-\&lt;5.0, 5.0-\&lt;5.5, and ≥5.5 mEq/L). Hierarchical logistic regression was used to determine the association between potassium levels and outcomes after adjusting for patient- and hospital-level factors.All-cause in-hospital mortality and the composite of ventricular fibrillation or cardiac arrest.There was a U-shaped relationship between mean postadmission serum potassium level and in-hospital mortality that persisted after multivariable adjustment. Compared with the reference group of 3.5 to less than 4.0 mEq/L (mortality rate, 4.8\%; 95\% CI, 4.4\%-5.2\%), mortality was comparable for mean postadmission potassium of 4.0 to less than 4.5 mEq/L (5.0\%; 95\% CI, 4.7\%-5.3\%), multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (OR), 1.19 (95\% CI, 1.04-1.36). Mortality was twice as great for potassium of 4.5 to less than 5.0 mEq/L (10.0\%; 95\% CI, 9.1\%-10.9\%; multivariable-adjusted OR, 1.99; 95\% CI, 1.68-2.36), and even greater for higher potassium strata. Similarly, mortality rates were higher for potassium levels of less than 3.5 mEq/L. In contrast, rates of ventricular fibrillation or cardiac arrest were higher only among patients with potassium levels of less than 3.0 mEq/L and at levels of 5.0 mEq/L or greater.Among inpatients with AMI, the lowest mortality was observed in those with postadmission serum potassium levels between 3.5 and \&lt;4.5 mEq/L compared with those who had higher or lower potassium levels.},

Although there is advantage in delivering sufficient levels of oxygen, hyperoxia is reported to be directly associated with increasing in-hospital deaths. Our previous studies reported ventricular and electrical remodeling in hyperoxia treated mouse hearts, and in this article, for the first time, we are investigating the effects of hyperoxia on atrial electrophysiology using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology experiments along with assessment of Kv1.5, Kv4.2, and KChIP2 transcripts and protein profiles using real-time quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting. Our data showed that induction of hyperoxia for 3 days in mice showed larger outward potassium currents with shorter action potential durations (APD). This increase in current densities is due to significant increase in ultrarapid delayed rectifier outward K+ currents (IKur) and rapidly activating, rapidly inactivating transient outward K+ current (Ito) densities. We also observed a significant increase in both transcripts and protein levels of Kv1.5 and KChIP2 in hyperoxia treated atrial cardiomyocytes, whereas no significant change was observed in Kv4.2 transcripts or protein. The data presented here further support our previous findings that hyperoxia induces not only ventricular remodeling, but also atrial electrical remodeling.},

	abstract = {Background
It is widely believed that plasma electrolyte levels are normally distributed. Statistical tests and calculations using plasma electrolyte data are often reported based on this assumption of normality. Examples include t tests, analysis of variance, correlations and confidence intervals. The purpose of our study was to determine whether plasma sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl−) and bicarbonate (HCO3−) distributions are indeed normally distributed.
Methods
We analyzed plasma electrolyte data from 237 consecutive adults (137 women and 100 men) who had normal results on a standard basic metabolic panel which included plasma electrolyte measurements. The skewness of each distribution (as a measure of its asymmetry) was compared to the zero skewness of a normal (Gaussian) distribution.
Results
The plasma Na+ distribution was skewed slightly to the right, but the skew was not significantly different from zero skew. The plasma Cl− distribution was skewed slightly to the left, but again the skew was not significantly different from zero skew. On the contrary, both the plasma K+ and HCO3− distributions were significantly skewed to the right (P {\textless} 0.01 zero skew). There was also a suggestion from examining frequency distribution curves that K+ and HCO3− distributions were bimodal.
Conclusions
In adults with a normal basic metabolic panel, plasma potassium and bicarbonate levels are not normally distributed and may be bimodal. Thus, statistical methods to evaluate these 2 plasma electrolytes should be nonparametric tests and not parametric ones that require a normal distribution.},

	abstract = {Oxygen therapy remains the main component of the ventilation strategy for treatment of patients with acute lung injury. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO2) is the intermittent administration of 100\% oxygen at pressure greater than sea level and has been applied widely to alleviate a variety of hypoxia-related tissue injuries. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of hyperbaric oxygen on acute lung injury induced by intratracheal spraying of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent implantation of a carotid artery catheter under general anesthesia. Aerosolized LPS was delivered twice into the lungs via intratracheal puncture. Animals were either breathing room air (n = 27) or subjected to hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) exposure (n = 27) 1 h after LPS spraying. Acute lung injury was evaluated 5 h and 24 h later. Compared with the control group, intratracheal spraying of LPS caused profound hypoxemia, greater wet/dry weight ratio (W/D) of the lung (5.67 ± 0.22 vs. 4.98 ± 0.19), and higher protein concentration (1706 ± 168 vs. 200 ± 90 mg/L) and LDH activity (129 ± 30 vs. 46 ± 15, mAbs/min) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Intratracheal spraying of LPS also caused significant WBC sequestration in the lung tissue. HBO2 treatment significantly reverted hypoxemia, reduced lung injury measures evaluated at 5 and 24 h, and enhanced 24-h animal survival rate (χ2 = 5.08, P = 0.024). The malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations in lung tissue and serum were both increased after LPS spraying. Neither single HBO2 therapy nor five sequential daily treatments enhanced MDA production in lung tissue or serum. Our results suggested that hyperbaric oxygen might reduce acute lung injury caused by intratracheal spraying of LPS in rats. This treatment modality is not associated with enhancement of oxidative stress to the lung.},

	abstract = {Effective metabolism is highly dependent on a narrow therapeutic range of oxygen. Accordingly, low levels of oxygen, or hypoxia, are one of the most powerful inducers of gene expression, metabolic changes, and regenerative processes, including angiogenesis and stimulation of stem cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. The sensing of decreased oxygen levels (hypoxia) or increased oxygen levels (hyperoxia), occurs through specialized chemoreceptor cells and metabolic changes at the cellular level, which regulate the response. Interestingly, fluctuations in the free oxygen concentration rather than the absolute level of oxygen can be interpreted at the cellular level as a lack of oxygen. Thus, repeated intermittent hyperoxia can induce many of the mediators and cellular mechanisms that are usually induced during hypoxia. This is called the hyperoxic-hypoxic paradox (HHP). This article reviews oxygen physiology, the main cellular processes triggered by hypoxia, and the cascade of events triggered by the HHP.},
