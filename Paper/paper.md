Increase in venous [K+] During Hyperbaric Exposure Independent of Changes in pH or O2 Concentration

Increase in venous [K+] During Hyperbaric Exposure

# Abstract
Plasma potassium regulation is important for function of numerous cells in the body. Changes in potassium levels during exposure to an increased O2 concentration is thought to be the result of the changes in pH and increasing reactive oxygen species. However, the effects of hyperbaria on plasma potassium concentration are not well understood.

Eight subjects were exposed to 1.3 atmospheres absolute (ATA) of hyperbaric air for 90 minutes, 10-times (M-F) over 12-days. Another eight subjects were exposed to 100% oxygen at 1 ATA over the same interval. Four venous blood draws were taken. On day 1 the first draw was taken immediately preceding treatment and the second was taken immediately following treatment. The third draw was taken prior to the 10th treatment and the 4th draw was taken 72 hours post final treatment. We analyzed samples on a blood gas analyzer and performed statistical analysis using a paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

The concentration group saw strong trend towards an increase in the potassium concentration from 4.09 ± 0.12 (mmol/L) to 4.28 ± 0.28 (mmol/L) (p = 0.065). In the hyperbaric group we see a significant increase in potassium concentration from 4.19 ± 0.26 (mmol/L) to 4.55 ± 0.27 (mmol/L) (p = 0.0068). In the concentration group we also see a significant increase in pH concentration from 7.37 ± 0.03 to 7.39 ± 0.01 (p= 0.021). A similar significant increase is not seen in the hyperbaric group.

These finding suggest that changes in potassium concentration in response to hyperbaria are not the result of oxygen concentration nor pH. Possible explanations include increased nitrogen levels due to hyperbaric air, increased CO2 concentration in hyperbaric chamber or changes in the activity of Na+,K+ ATPase pumps at the cellular level which may be a homeostatic response to combat pulmonary edema

# Introduction

|       Plasma potassium levels are dependent on a multitude of factors and result from the interplay of intracellular and extracellular changes and intake and execration rates.[@aronson_effects_2011; @adrogue_changes_1981; @ingelfinger_integrated_2015] While potassium is mostly a intracellular cation signiﬁcant levels are observed extracellular.[@gupta_distribution_2017] Extracellular plasma potassium levels are heavly regulated to fall within a narrow range of 3.5 to 5.0 mmol per liter and maintenance at these concentrations are of extreme importance to the function of many organs in the body.[@youn_recent_2009, @ingelfinger_integrated_2015] This is underscored by the fact that both hypokalemia or hyperkalemia lead to an increased death rate in certain conditions.[@torlen_serum_2012; @goyal_serum_2012] Based on these findings, the determination of pathways of regulation that lead to changes in plasma potassium levels is of importantance.

|       Classic explanations for variations in plasma potassium levels emphasize the importance of acid-base distribution through thier effects on ion transporters.[@aronson_effects_2011] Ion exchanges involving $H+$, $Na+$, $HCO_3^-$ and $Cl-$ are iomportant for maintaining the intracellular and extracellular levels of potassium.[@aronson_effects_2011] Renal function is also of importantance in regulation of potassium.[@aronson_effects_2011] All previously mentioned ions and thier transporters and the hormone aldostreone play a central role in renal excretion and reuptake rates of potassium.[@aronson_effects_2011] Although acid-base distribution, ion-exchange and renal excretion/reabsorbtion provide the greatest explanation of plasma potassium levels other factors have been shown to influence thier physiological concentrations.FIXME The factors under investigation in this study that may lead to changes in plasma potassium levels are the effects of $O_2$ concentration and increased pressure.

|       Modulation of inspired $O_2$ concentration has been used as an effectives treatment for many conditions. The two main methods to administer this concentration increase are by directly varying concentration of inspired gases or by varying the ambient pressure. By combining these to aspects of concentration, three of the main modes of $O_2$ administration are obtained. These are hyperbaric $O_2$, concentrated $O_2$ and hyperbaric treatment. According the UHMS hyperbaric oxygen therapy ($HBO_2$) is defined as exposure to near 100% $O_2$ while inside a pressurized chamber at greater than sea level pressure.[@moon_hyperbaric_2019] As of July 2021 the FDA has cleared $HBO_2$ for 13 different conditions.[@noauthor_hyperbaric_2021] In contrast hyperbaric treatment is exposure to an increase in pressure without an increase in administered gas $O_2$ concentration. Finally concentrated oxygen is the exposure to $O_2$ gas with a higher concentration of $O_2$ than normal air. Concentrated oxygen and hyperbaric treatment were the two treatments administered in this study.

|       Effects of hyperoxia on plasma potassium levels remain ambiguous.[@adrogue_changes_1981] A few studies have demonstrated an increase in plasma potassium as the result of hyperoxic exposure while others have found no similar increase.[@adrogue_changes_1981; @fraley_isohydric_1976] However research has shown that hyperoxia can effect voltage-gated K+ channels in humans[@zyrianova_k2p21_2020; @schwingshackl_regulation_2012; @chapalamadugu_high_2015] One group found that long-term exposure to hyperoxia can result in a decrease in activity of voltage-gated K+ channels in lung tissue.[@zyrianova_k2p21_2020; @schwingshackl_regulation_2012] Where as another study looking at voltage-gated K+ channels of the heart and saw a signifigant reduction of oxygen-sensitive Kv1.5 potassium channel protein expression.[@chapalamadugu_high_2015] Internal potassium homeostasis and the distribution of intracellular and extracellular potassium in the body is primarly the reuslt of ion-exchanges pumps and passive efflux.[@ingelfinger_integrated_2015; @aronson_effects_2011] Hypoxia has also been shown to cause an increase in arterial potassium levels and cause changes in expression of Voltage gated K+ channel in pulmonary arterial myocytes through $HIF1-\alpha$ indicating some pathway through which potassium levels are modulated via changes in $O_2$ concentration.[@barlow_effect_1994; @whitman_endothelin-1_2008; @dong_hypoxia_2012; @semenza_regulation_2009] Therefore changes in activity or expression of these channels offers a potential linkage between effects hyperoxia on plasma poatassium.

|       The main goal of this study was to determine the similarities and differences in effects of conentrated $O_2$ and hyperbaria on the blood metabolites, specifically plasma potassium levels.

# Methods

|       Healthy adult subjects were recruited via REDCap using a University of Wisconsin's email list. A questionnaire was administered to determine characteristics of individuals such as pre-existing conditions and age. Individuals who responded to the survey were selected at random contacted via phone. Participants in the study were separated into two groups. The first group received hyperbaric treatment in altitude sickness bags (n=14) while the second group received concentrated oxygen at room pressure (n=12).

|       Although treatment varied between groups, treatment schedule remained consistent and was the following. Subjects arrived Monday and height and weight were determined. Blood collected via venipuncture before treatment was used for a baseline metabolic panel and analyzed on arterial blood gas (ABG) machine. Following blood draws subjects underwent 1.5 hours of their respective treatments. After treatment blood was collected to determine acute response in blood metabolites. Following this, treatment was given Tuesday through Friday of the following week, taking a break for weekends where no treatment was administered. A blood draw and ABG analysis was preformed before the tenth and final treatment. After a weekend of no treatment following the final treatment a blood draw occurred and subsequent analysis was preformed.

|       A total of 36 metabolic indicators were reported by the ABG machine. Indicators were compared pairwise between the four draws. Statistical analysis and data visualization was performed using R (The R Foundation) and paired student t-tests.

# Results

|       Tables one and two display values for classical ions of interest in potassium homeostasis for concentrated $O_2$ and hyperbaric air respectively. The concentrated $O_2$ group saw a signiﬁcant increase in pH from baseline levels of $7.374 \pm 0.029$ to post exsposure levels of $7.393 \pm 0.014$(p=0.023) while the hyperbaric group saw no similar signifigant increase. Potassium levels were also increased in both the concentrated $O_2$ group and the hyperbaric oxygen group immediately post exposure. In the concentrated group the potassium levels were increased from $4.09 \pm 0.12$ pre-exposure to $4.28 \pm 0.28$ post-exposure.(p= 0.046) Whereas in the hyperbaric group a greater incraese was observed with pre-exposure levels at $4.19 \pm 0.26$ and post-exposure levels at $4.55 \pm 0.27^{*}$.(p=0.007046). Calcium levels were also incrased from basline levels of $1.19 \pm 0.04$ for both immediately post-exposure at $1.21 \pm 0.03$(p=0.043) and 24 hours post-exposure at $1.22 \pm 2 0.02^*$(p=0.047) however no similar change was observed in the hyperbaric group.

# Discussion

|      Based on the fact that the classical metabolites implicated in plasma potassium levels experienced no significant fluctuations this hints at a possible novel relationship between plasma potassium and hyperbaric treatment. However, limitations of this study mean that an exact explication for the observed plasma potassium levels in the hyperbaric group was not be determined. In spite of this fact several possible explanations based on findings in the literature and conditions present in this study arose and were as follows: an increase in hyperbaric chamber $CO_2$ resulting in mild respratory acidosis, increase in $N_2$ and creation of reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in tissue, potassium mediated fluctuations in vasoconstriction/dilation in resonse to changes in pressure and changes in potassium channel expression via $HIF-1\alpha$.
|      Correlations between respratory acidosis and an increase in plasma potassium have been reported with few exceptions.[@adrogue_changes_1981] During hyperbaric exprosure subjects exprienced an increase of levels of $CO_2$ by =FIXME:INSERT CO2 LEVELS IN CHAMBER==. Subject expired gases and a lack of outflow of those respired gases in the altitude sickness bags is most likely responsible for the increase in $CO_2$ observed in chamber.

|      Further limitations of this study include lack of dietary restrictions on subjects, single Pre vs Post draw time point and variations between treatment cohorts.
